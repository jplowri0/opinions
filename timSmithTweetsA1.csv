The bushfires are severely impacting businesses around country Victoria  which is why the Liberal Nationals have called for a two year waiver of council rates Milawa relies on tourism  but the fires have kept visitors away Great to meet with Gamze Smokehouse with Tim_McCurdy pictwittercomIlG7dIZvHz,0.8,0.75
Yes that’s true  but during this crisis these local councils can’t lose revenue  they have vital services to perform  so if rates are to be waived for two years the state government will need to make up the shortfall in councils revenue,0.15,0.35000000000000003
Simply asking the govt to do something in a crisis isn’t unreasonable I’m an MP & a Shadow Minister it’s my job to represent people and bring ideas forward- particularly at this time  to hopefully get a better response from the govt for people who’ve lost everything,0.2222222222222222,0.3968253968253968

Without action from this Labor govt  property owners whose homes have been burnt down would still be required to pay council rates  This is just wrong   We need action immediately from Daniel Andrews on this significant financial burden on people who are doing it so tough,-0.06706349206349208,0.44246031746031755
The Andrews Labor Govt must provide council rates relief now for Victorians who have lost everything from bushfires Rates relief should also extend to local businesses that have been severely impacted by these horrendous fires   https:wwwheraldsuncomaunewsvictoriaoppositions-push-for-fireravaged-residents-to-have-council-rates-slashednews-storya97bf16cbc90b4ff33dcc4a5bb8e7a7c …,0.0,0.0
