48,and not the police and ADF like every other state NSW has not had 1 transmission of Covid from hotel quarantine into the community Once it got into the community Victoria’s contract tracing was abysmal Look at NSW they’re dealing with their cases so efficiently
49,Andrews is trying to the blame the people and he’s right a small minority of Victorians are doing the wrong thing I can’t believe 25 of infected persons visited by the ADF weren’t home 🤬  But the cause of this second wave was his government using untrained security guards

158,Chairman Dan was tough on golf fishing and getting children back to school Totally irrelevant in stopping the spread of the virus 🦠So I can’t believe the Andrews Labor government didn’t force quarantined travellers to get tested for Covid-19🤦🏼‍♀️🤷‍♂️🤬 https://twittercom/TheTodayShow/status/1276656469082083328 …

330,You of all people should understand there are many ways to engage with the public and many believe Andrews is governing in an arbitrary and arrogant fashion Perfect example was cafes announcement today which Dan was dragged to through community and political opposition
331,What about your shameless hypocrisy? I asked in February what retirement gig the Labor Party was giving him  you became distressed at that assertion  funnily enough he’s now been appointed deputy chief spinner - have you anything to say ?
332,Jane it’s a year since Labor lost the federal election and you’re not tweeting from New Zealand - I assume ? What happened ? Auckland not to your taste ? All the best
333,Anything from CameronBaud7 or bellfrances ?
334,What’s your preferred label for Daniel Andrews ? Poll closes 6pm Monday
335,Fair point Stay tuned

337,Once again Chairman Dan has been dragged kicking and screaming to putting Victorians’ interests ahead of his power tripHe said he wasn’t going to think about opening cafes until 31 May if at all How much anxiety has Dan caused small businesses and their staff in the meantime? https://twittercom/tminear/status/1261804411606585344 …
338,Again proving Dictator Dan is closer to China than Canberra Cafe owners in 7 States and Territories get to choose whether they serve patrons -but in Victoria Chairman Dan overrides health advice and makes a business decision for them prolonging their losses for another 2 weeks https://twittercom/DougalBeatty/status/1261802709969068032 …
339,So opening cafes and restaurants is being treated by Dictator Dan like the schools announcement String people along leaks to media no clear roadmap for people’s whose very livelihoods are resting on these decisions Stop causing heartache with your power trips Dan https://twittercom/msanto92/status/1261775853400162304 …

343,But it’s great you’re focusing on issues that are impacting the lives of Victoria’s small business owners and their staff even if it’s because of my tweets Trying to get you lot to question Daniel Andrews requires more effort than usual at the moment
344,You had a sook about what I said on sunriseon7 but instead of whingeing about my language why don’t you ask this Labor govt why the rules are much harsher here than NSW? Why can’t cafes open for patrons ? What would Andrews know about the financial viability of restaurants?
345,In Victoria with control freak wowsers like Dictator Dan running the show you can’t even sit down for a coffee let alone a beer Our Premier is such a friendless loser of course Victoria has no plans to reopen licensed venueswho would invite Lurch for a drink?danhasnomates pictwittercom/rFGqJbGx9i

353,Dan could’ve let anxious parents and kids know this on FridayOr on Sunday after the leak to Media_Matt by someone in his own team Or yesterday But he’s strung it out for days until the polling became catastrophic Start putting Victorians first and your ego second Chairman
354,After doing the school run how will parents have time to home school their other children who aren’t allowed to attend school ? Has any genius thought this through ? How will these parents get any of their own work done in the morning ?
355,Daniel Andrews has split families with children in years prep-2 3-10 or 11-12Can you imagine the mayhem in families where parents have to take a grade 2 student to school whilst keeping a grade 4 home ?How will the grade 4 student start home schooling on time ?
356,Can everyone see how Chairman Dan and his deputy chihuahua are shamelessly manipulating this crisis?Andrews chooses the morning he faces questioning by PAEC on handling of Cedar Meats to announce a return to schoolwhich he could have made yesterday  should have made weeks ago
357,I reckon most parents found looking at the Premier smirking on qanda highly irritating as he refused to disclose what his plans are to get their kids back in the classroom Now a panicked press conference at 7:45AM will Andrews give parents hope or more relentless negativity?

433,Victorians have lost their jobs parents are trying to manage home schooling while they workthere’s no elective surgery  they even tried a bonking banWe’re all trying to survive this pandemic by doing the right thing but surely we can ask why different rules apply in Vic ?
434,I don’t play golf but do other states have a lower regard for human life because they allow golf and fishing to continue? It’s ok in fact it’s vital to subject those making these decisions to some scrutinyWhy aren’t you asking these important questions too?
435,Prof Murphy and the AHPPC publish their advice at  http://healthgovau  Why did Dr Sutton agree with the AHPPC that it’s safe for children to attend school and then tweet the opposite? Why did he then backflip on his backflip ? Why is the advice different in Victoria? pictwittercom/IFWrkak0st
436,This was never just about golf This is about an un-elected official having huge control over our lives and making decisions that are inconsistent with the rest of 🇦🇺 Victorians have a right to ask questions and not be shouted down given huge sacrifices people are making
437,Thanks VictorianCHO for admitting on 3AW693 tonight that Victoria’s golf ban “isn’t based on science” If not science then why is a Victorian golf course a risk to life but every other 🇦🇺 course isn’t?
438,As the son of a proud Croweater I’m pleased to say your Governor is an awesome example to the whole Nation
439,Mate seriously that’s one of your children isn’t it ?
440,You could have blown me down with a feather 
441,So get your bloke Sutton to detail why various harmless activities can’t be undertaken in Victoria Is it because of the cooler weather here ? No it’s because the Premier of Victoria is a strange man with a tendency to bully those who report to him
442,What a completely stupid comment - I’m referring to other Australian jurisdictions
443,Omg 
444,No I’m actually disgusted someone like you who isn’t questioning the bullshit we are being told by Daniel Andrews and his CHO Why won’t they release the advice and science ? It’s not about golf it’s an  example of the punitive rules in Victoria that exist nowhere else in 🇦🇺
445,Sorry mate Andrews just backflipped again he’s banned golf again
446,I’d be happy to do “as the Chief Health Officer says” but because no other state has the same ridiculous rules as Victoria I naturally question this decree Provide the evidence and we might believe that Dr Sutton is providing independent advice not sprouting Dan’s decrees https://twittercom/ShingvWorld/status/1251082339460866050 …
447,Oh for goodness sake get him to provide his evidence  not sprout Daniel’s lines We all know when under pressure Daniel becomes quite the bully 
448,We don’t care about your views we want to know about the science that underpins your advice Show us your evidence as to why various individual sporting pursuits are banned in Victoria but no other state in Australia ?

452,We live in a democracy - it’s my constitutional obligation as an opposition MP to ask the government that is ruling by decree why is golf banned in the state of Victoria but in no other Australian jurisdiction? Why won’t the govt release the science justifying their decision?
453,Mate I respect your opinion but seriously no other health officer in Australia has banned golf or fishing if social distance is observed Why won’t the chief health officer in Victoria release the science or modelling as to why it must be like this south of the Murray River?
454,Victoria’s Covid directions make it clear that you can go for a walk with another person if social distance is observed As Winston Churchill said “golf spoils a good walk” so what’s the difference ? pictwittercom/MJlZnCHXXM
455,Yeah fair call mate - his bans on fishing golf  and originally bonking were just nuts
456,Why won’t Victoria’s Chief Health Officer Dr Sutton and his minder Daniel Andrews disclose to us all the science and modelling that shows the epidemiology of why golf with social distancing is banned south of the Murray River but perfectly fine in Albury ?

511,I heard you praising Daniel Andrews this morning; you  mjrowland68 should be talking about the genuine panic confusion  stress Andrew’s unilateral statement yesterday has caused business owners  their staff over the last 24 hours All angles of this story are important
512,Any response from Daniel Andrews ? Where is his list ? Is it different from the National Cabinet resolution ? He’s causing mass panic in Victoria
513,We really really need some clarity from the state government in Victoria Businesses large and small are completely confused
514,So the question I’m being asked tonight will the Victorian Government list of non-essential services to close - that Andrews will announce tomorrow - be the same as the list the PM announced tonight ?
515,Yes but JoshFrydenberg announced a $175 billion stimulus package - with another on the way - Andrews has not announced any support for business unlike every other govt in 🇦🇺so Andrews is at odds with advice to invest and the actions of every other state govt

541,Hearing Labor has decided to call it a night - should have happened 3 hours ago
542,Which is why Libs and Nats voted against sitting past 12am
543,Wrong again Our amendments were drafted literally weeks ago and I was briefing members of the x-bench weeks ago on them Why on earth are you having a crack at me for Labor circulating their amendments late? You’re tired it’s late sleep on it and let’s talk later today

561,That’s a disgraceful decision
562,But I’m sure TimWilsonMP is delighted to hear that 
563,Kew actually - that’s TimWilsonMP
564,Mate the facts are simple a psycho murdered his kids and estranged wife - I am sure you understand this sort of barbarity just not in 🇦🇺 I’m no lefty I’m no bleeding heart These are facts this happened and it can’t be excused by anyone for any reason
565,What more evidence do you need ? There are eyewitness accounts of this man dousing his wife and kids in petrol and burning them alive ? What’s wrong with you ?
566,You’ve clearly been deployed on behalf of us all to kick the crap out 🇦🇺 enemies Thank you  now tell me do you really think someone should be given an AM for talking shit most of her professional life and then attempting to justify the murder by a father of his wife and kids?
567,C’mon mate are you seriously with that badge on twitter account trying to justify some sadist who burned his own children alive ?
568,Today I wrote to the Chair of the Council for the Order of Australia to formally ask the Council to advise the Governor-General that Bettina Arndt’s AM be cancelled because of her comments that sought to excuse extreme violence Her comments will “bring disrepute on the Order” pictwittercom/fizGF1fP7o
569,Good
570,Oh it’s you ? I’d forgotten about you you’re still a tool and you’re still irrelevant BlockBettina
571,No it’s not The PM loves his family and has paid a high political price for prioritising his girls over his job this summer This isn’t a left/right - Labor/Liberal issue - this is a right/wrong issue and Bettina Arndt is completely wrong
572,Stay tuned
573,You seem to be directing a lot of anger towards me I would have thought we are all in furious agreement tonight on this issue ?
574,I’ve no doubt when the next issue arises normality will return In the meantime I think we can all agree this transcends left/right Labor/Liberal This is right v wrong And Bettina Arndt got this so terribly wrong
575,Read my previous tweet
576,Sorry that’s wrong On advice of the Council of the Order of Australia the Crown awards recipients with their award Unlike other Commonwealth countries the federal govt does not advise the Governor-General on who should be awarded an Order of Australia
577,Thanks John
578,Because the Order of Australia should be above politics
579,Upon further reflection I think these comments are so grotesque that this woman must not be awarded an AM which was announced on Australia Day I hate saying that but she must not be recognised in any way as an outstanding Australian https://twittercom/thebettinaarndt/status/1230623373232787456 …

634,Yes that’s true but during this crisis these local councils can’t lose revenue they have vital services to perform so if rates are to be waived for two years the state government will need to make up the shortfall in councils revenue
635,Simply asking the govt to do something in a crisis isn’t unreasonable I’m an MP  a Shadow Minister it’s my job to represent people and bring ideas forward- particularly at this time to hopefully get a better response from the govt for people who’ve lost everything
636,I received a very detailed briefing from a number of government agencies and ministerial staff at Parliament House last week on the bushfire response in my portfolio areas - which I greatly appreciatedI raised the issue of council rates then
637,They’ve been told by me in person
